##Project Goals:

- Archival and sharing of Real-time data
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Reporting on the quality, consistency, and availabiity of real-time data from the MTA
- Reporting on "timeliness" of individual bus routes by comparing real-time data to schedules
- Building a more developer-friendly proxy API with good documentation so that third parties can build apps using this real-time data wihtout having to figure out the vendor's undocumented API
